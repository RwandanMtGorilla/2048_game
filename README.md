# 2048 Game in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of the popular game 2048, written in C.

## Features

- Command line interface for a classic 2048 experience.
- Move tiles using the arrow keys (`2`, `4`, `6`, `8`) or the traditional WASD controls (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`).
- The game keeps track of your current score.

## Compilation

Make sure you have a C compiler (like `gcc`) installed on your system. Then, navigate to the directory containing the game's source code and compile it with:

```bash
gcc -o 2048_game 2048.c
```

## How to Play
- After compilation, run the game using:

```bash
./2048_game
```

- Use the 2, 4, 6, 8 or W, A, S, D keys to move the tiles.
- Try to combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile, and get the highest score possible!
- The game ends when the grid is full and no more moves can be made.
